                <p class="projectPara">The Ahmedabad re-branding competition was an open design competition for graphic artists and design thinkers. The task was design a symbol for the city and develop a design language that shows in merchendise, city service apps/websites and stationary for the city's authorities.  Consequentially, this graphic design exercise was a means to re-brand the city itself. The entire design language/colour palette was derived from the logo. Interestingly, the logo design exercise was a back and forth process to create a logo that doesn't just represent the city but allow its graphic elements to be used as a recipe for merchandise & stationary design.  </p>
